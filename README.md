# Java-Assignments-Exercises-
1st Semester deliverables (Introductory Programming)

- Assignments: Mandatory weekly deliverables.
- Exercises: Non-mandatory ones, but recommended together with kattis.
- **Java Basics**: I bought a udemy course just to understand the java basics better simultaneously with my introductory programming course. But the main reason behind it was to **train git commands** pushing them in my repository. I tried to implement more and more commands every day for every single file of them, since Git and Github weren't a huge part (maybe not at all) of my master's.
